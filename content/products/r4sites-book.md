In 2018, I had virtually no online presence other than about 100 random LinkedIn connections. I knew this was a problem given my budding interest in Data Science, the increasing demand for project portfolios, and my perceived need to "stand out" in the digital crowd.

So, I learned how to publish my first personal website, [Abnormal Distributions](https://abndistro.com/){target="_blank"}. Yes, I know, it looks outdated and definitely not as cool as [this website](https://benc.dev/){target="_blank"}. However, Abnormal Distributions took my online presence and my career to new heights. Since going live, Abnormal Distributions has served over 50,000 page views and 20,000 users from [all over the world](https://i.imgur.com/Qvx08ry.png){target="_blank"}. I began posting content on LinkedIn with links to my website, and in the span of a year I received 1,700 LinkedIn connection requests from Data Scientists and professionals in related fields. I began receiving job opportunities from recruiters who discovered me by landing on my website. Abnormal Distributions sparked my creativity, deepened my subject matter expertise through writing, and gave me the tools I needed to confidently engage with the digital crowd. It turned out to be a wonderful investment of time and energy.

**My goal with this book is to help you launch your own personal website** and, hopefully, experience the same personal transformation that I experienced after I launched mine. 

You will learn the exact methodology that I use to create, design, publish, and analyze websites using R, RStudio, and other freely available tools including GitHub, Hugo, Netlify, and Google Analytics. No prior experience in web development, R, or any of the aforementioned tools is needed to be successful with this book.
