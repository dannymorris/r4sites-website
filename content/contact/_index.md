Hi! My name is Danny Morris, and thanks for checking out my book. I am an industry Data Scientist with a background in R and predictive analytics. I love writing, sharing information, and helping people grow their careers. 

A few years ago, I launched [my personal blog](https://abndistro.com) using the methodology described in my book to share information with the Data Science community, promote my work, and enrich my online presence. My goal with this book is to help you launch your own website and experience the same personal transformation I did after I launched mine. This book is perfect for students, working professional, and researchers who want to promote themselves and their work.
